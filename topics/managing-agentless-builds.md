If a build does not require an agent for final operations, it can release its agent, and this agent will become available to other builds. Builds that finish on their own in third-party software and report statuses directly to the TeamCity server are called [_agentless builds_](agentless-build.md).

## Detaching build agent

To release its current build agent, a build needs to send the `##teamcity[detachedFromAgent]` [service message](service-messages.md) (for example, via a [REST API request](#Logging+messages)). We highly recommend detaching a build from the agent only during its last step. Make sure the tasks performed outside of TeamCity do not require a build agent.

After the build is detached, TeamCity skips all the following [build steps](configuring-build-steps.md), unless they have the "[_Always, even if build stop command was issued_](configuring-build-steps.md#Execution+policy)" option enabled. If necessary, you can enable it for mandatory final steps â€“ the agent will be released only after completing them.
                        
A detached agent instantly becomes available to other builds. Agentless builds should report all status information directly to a TeamCity server.

## Logging build data

Agentless builds can send their logs from external tools to the TeamCity server and perform any other requests via [REST API](rest-api.md).

To perform requests, you need to use [build-level authentication](artifact-dependencies.md#Build-level+authentication) credentials. Use the following [build system properties](configuring-build-parameters.md):
* `%system.teamcity.auth.userId%`
* `%system.teamcity.auth.password%`

You also need to specify the [build ID](working-with-build-results.md#Internal+Build+ID) and server URL:
* `%teamcity.build.id%`
* `%teamcity.serverUrl%`

### Logging messages

To log messages, use the following call:

```shell script
POST /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/log 
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request POST http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/log --data <message> --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

Here, you can send the [`detach`](#Detaching+build+agent) or any other service message as `<message>`.

An example request to send a warning:

```shell script
POST /app/rest/builds/id:TestBuild/log 
(curl -v --basic --user johnsmith:password1 --request POST http://localhost:8111/app/rest/builds/id:TestBuild/log --data "##teamcity[message text='Deployment failed' errorDetails='stack trace' status='ERROR']" --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

>To structure service messages in the build log, use [_flow tracking_](service-messages.md#Message+FlowId).

### Finishing build

It is important to ensure that an agentless build delivers a finishing request to the server. If the server is temporarily unavailable and cannot receive this request on time, the build should retry until this operation is successful. Without the finishing request, the build will be running on the TeamCity server indefinitely, until reaching its specified timeout, if any.

To finish a build, use the following call:

```shell script
PUT /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finish
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request PUT http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

Alternatively, you can finish it by sending the exact finish date:

```shell script
PUT /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request PUT http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate --data '' --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

In `--data ''`, specify the build finish timestamp in the `yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmssZ` format. Leave the value empty to use the current time.

## Agentless builds' licensing

The number of agentless builds is limited by the number of your active [agent licenses](licensing-policy.md#Number+of+Agents).
