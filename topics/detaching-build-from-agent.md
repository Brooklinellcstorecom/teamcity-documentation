[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Detaching Build from Agent)

If a build does not require an [agent](build-agent.md) at the final steps, it can release its agent, and this agent will become available to other builds. During such [_agentless steps_](agentless-build-step.md), the build runs in an external software and reports directly to the TeamCity server.

## Detaching build agent

To release its current build agent, a build needs to send the `##teamcity[detachedFromAgent]` [service message](service-messages.md) (for example, via a [REST API request](#Logging+messages)). We highly recommend detaching the agent only during the last build step. Make sure the tasks performed outside TeamCity do not require a build agent.

After receiving this message, the agent detaches and skips all the following agentless steps, unless they have the "[_Always, even if build stop command was issued_](configuring-build-steps.md#Execution+policy)" execution policy enabled. If necessary, you can enable it for mandatory final steps â€“ the agent will be released only after completing them.
                        
A detached agent instantly becomes available to other builds. During agentless steps, the build should report all status information directly to the TeamCity server.

## Logging build data

Without an agent, a build can send its logs and perform any other requests to TeamCity via [REST API](rest-api.md).

To perform a request, it needs to provide:

* [build-level authentication](artifact-dependencies.md#Build-level+authentication) credentials specified as [build system properties](configuring-build-parameters.md):
   * `%system.teamcity.auth.userId%`
   * `%system.teamcity.auth.password%`
* [build ID](working-with-build-results.md#Internal+Build+ID): `%teamcity.build.id%`
* TeamCity server URL: `%teamcity.serverUrl%`

### Logging messages

To log messages, use the following call:

```shell script
POST /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/log 
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request POST http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/log --data <message> --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

Here, you can send the [`detach`](#Detaching+build+agent) or any other service message as `<message>`.

An example request to send a warning:

```shell script
POST /app/rest/builds/id:TestBuild/log 
(curl -v --basic --user johnsmith:password1 --request POST http://localhost:8111/app/rest/builds/id:TestBuild/log --data "##teamcity[message text='Deployment failed' errorDetails='stack trace' status='ERROR']" --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

>To structure service messages in a build log, use [_flow tracking_](service-messages.md#Message+FlowId).

### Finishing build

It is important to ensure that a build, executed externally, delivers a finishing request to the TeamCity server. If the server is temporarily unavailable and cannot receive this request on time, the build should retry until this operation is successful. Without the finishing request, the build will be running on the TeamCity server indefinitely, until reaching its specified timeout, if any.

To finish a build, use the following call:

```shell script
PUT /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finish
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request PUT http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

Alternatively, you can finish it by sending the exact finish date:

```shell script
PUT /app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate
(curl -v --basic --user <username>:<password> --request PUT http://<teamcity.url>/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/finishDate --data '' --header "Content-Type: text/plain")
```

In `--data ''`, specify the build finish timestamp in the `yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmssZ` format. Leave the value empty to use the current time.

## Agentless builds' licensing

The number of builds that can simultaneously run without an agent is limited by the number of your active [agent licenses](licensing-policy.md#Number+of+Agents).
