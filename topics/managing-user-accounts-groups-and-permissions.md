Before creating and managing user accounts, groups and changing users' permissions, we recommend that you read about the following concepts:

* [User Account](user-account.md)	
* [Guest User](guest-user.md)
* [User Group](user-group.md)
* [Role and Permission](role-and-permission.md)

These pages contain essential information about user accounts, their roles, and permissions in TeamCity.

In this section:

* [Managing Users and User Groups](managing-users-and-user-groups.md)
* [Viewing Users and User Groups](viewing-users-and-user-groups.md)
* [Managing Roles](managing-roles.md)
