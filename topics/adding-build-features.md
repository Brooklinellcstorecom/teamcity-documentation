A _build feature_ is a piece of functionality that can be added to a build configuration to affect running builds or reporting build results.

The __Build Configuration Settings | Build Features__ page displays the configured features and allows you to manage them. It is possible to disable a configured build feature temporarily or permanently at any time, even if it is inherited from a build configuration template.

Refer to the sidebar to see all currently available build features.
