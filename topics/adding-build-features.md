A _build feature_ is a piece of functionality that can be added to a build configuration to affect running builds or reporting build results.

The __Build Configuration Settings | Build Features__ page displays the configured features and allows you to manage them. It is possible to disable a configured build feature temporarily or permanently at any time, even if it is inherited from a build configuration template using the option in the last column of the Build Features list.
